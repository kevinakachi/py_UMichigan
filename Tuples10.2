10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.


name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
dic = dict()

for line in handle:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        line = line.split()
        email = line[5]
        email = email.split(":")
        h = email[0]
        dic[h] = dic.get(h,0) +1
        
counts = []
for day, h in dic.items():
    counts.append((day, h))
    
counts.sort()
for day, h in counts:
    print (day, h)
